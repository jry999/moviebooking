		<p>Chandler Muriel Bing is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by actor Matthew Perry.[2] Chandler was born to Nora Tyler Bing, an erotic romance novelist, 
		and Charles Bing, a gay female impersonator and star of a Las Vegas drag show called "Viva Las Gay-gas" as Helena Handbasket. Chandler is of Scottish and Swedish descent.
		[citation needed] He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family.[citation needed] His parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when 
		Chandler was nine years old, an event which gave him trauma and now he refuses to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood and develop his notorious sense of humor as a defense 
		mechanism. It is revealed in season 1 that he went to an all-boys high school.</p>

		<p>Chandler's best friends are Joey Tribbiani, who is his roommate, and Ross Geller, with whom he previously lived. He met Ross' sister, Monica Geller, and her friend, Rachel Green, 
		while celebrating Thanksgiving at Ross' parents' house. Chandler was the first person to know about Ross' love for Rachel.[citation needed] He moved to New York City and lives 
		across the hall from Monica and, through her, meets Phoebe Buffay. Chandler has a very good sense of humor, and is notoriously sarcastic. He attributes his sarcasm as a defense 
		mechanism he developed due to his parents' divorcing when he was a child. He is the highest earning member of his friends' circle on account of responsible income management, 
		having learned the value of money from a young age.[citation needed] He suffers from commitment issues, but later marries Monica at the end of season 7. In season 10, Chandler 
		and Monica go on to adopt twins, Jack and Erica. His birthday is celebrated on the 8th of April, even though there are misconceptions that it is on the 24th of April.</p>

		<h2 id="career">Career</h2><!--creating id-->
		
		<p>Chandler works in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.[citation needed] Despite disliking his job, Chandler stays because they keep giving him promotions and 
		raises, eventually becoming boss to his old workmates. His friends do not understand what he does; during the contest for Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel guesses 
		"Transponster" for his job title. This results in Chandler and Joey winning the apartment.</P>

		<p>In the episode "The One Where Emma Cries", Chandler falls asleep during a meeting and on waking, realizes that he had agreed to head the new division in Tulsa. Chandler 
		quits his job on Christmas, so that he can fly home to New York to be with Monica. Monica helps Chandler secure a job in advertising through an old colleague of hers. 
		Much to Chandler's dismay, he begins as an unpaid intern. However, his more mature approach eventually pays off, and he secures a full-time job in the business as a junior 
		copywriter, which he enjoys much more than his previous career.</P>
